# Crop Recommendation System

## Description

This project is a Crop Recommendation System built using machine learning. It predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and climatic conditions. The system utilizes a RandomForestClassifier model trained on a dataset of crop yields and corresponding environmental factors.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
Use code with caution
bash git clone

 
2. **Install required libraries:**
Use code with caution
bash pip install -r requirements.txt

 
## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:** Ensure you have the necessary soil and climatic data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).
2. **Run the prediction script:**
Use code with caution
bash python predict.py --data_path

 
3. **View the results:** The predicted crop will be displayed in the output.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing information about various crops, including their yields and corresponding environmental factors such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## Model

The Crop Recommendation System utilizes a RandomForestClassifier model, which is a robust and accurate machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.
